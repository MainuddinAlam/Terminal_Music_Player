# Terminal_Music_Player
Project to play music in the terminal

1) Reasons for making this project

This is a personal project where I created to listen to music as I code. Since, I use the terminal frequently as I code, I thought it would be nice to play music in it too. It helps me from getting distracted.

2) Installation process
